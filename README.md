# Keygen

Simple program that allows you to generate license keys (for whatever purpose you desire). If successful, program will return a green `Successfully generated key!` message. All keys are then stored in a file `database.txt`. Can only generate one key at a time currently. Could easily be transformed into an executable with pyinstaller.

TO DO:
- Prompt for how many keys you'd like to generate.
